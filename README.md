Oh lawd. 4 years later, discovering my old github account.
Added some lines to this log file!

Many things in life have changed since back in the days!
Changed my subject of studying, moved from HTW to Beuth, Geoinformatics now.

Also, it was nearly a month that I had a girlfriend back in 2014-10-16. We cancelled this on 2016-11-26 I believe. Was a good decision, even though I do not regret our relationship. 

Finally, I do not know who can read these lines. If you happen to do so: 
Keep in mind to never forget about taking care of yourself, cause who else is gonna do it?
